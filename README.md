# NFC Pokemon App
This is an app created to learn about the assymetric encryption capabilities of NFC tags.

Admins can view, edit and write new pokemon tags with a private key encryption that locks the tag from 3rd party tampering.

Users have the public key through the app, allowing them to read the tags to see what pokemon is on each one.

Outside malicious attempts are made impossible through the locking of these tags, as once it is written to, a 3rd party cannot write over or delete it's contents.
